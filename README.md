# Other CTFs and Challenges

Welcome to my repository for documenting my progress on various Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, war games, and other cybersecurity puzzles. This is a collection of my solutions, notes, and experiences from participating in different CTF platforms, including (but not limited to) web challenges, reverse engineering, cryptography, and more.

Some categories you might find here:
- **Binary Exploitation**
- **Cryptography**
- **Forensics**
- **Web Security**
- **Reverse Engineering**
- **Miscellaneous Cybersecurity Challenges**

Note that this is a private repository for documenting my own progress and does not invite contributions.

## Why This Repository?

As I do more CTFs and challenges, I wanted a place to:
- Keep track of challenges I've solved and how I solved them.
- Review and revisit tricky challenges for future reference.
- Organize my learning process in a structured manner.

## Challenge Sources

This repository covers a variety of challenge platforms:
- **War games** (self-hosted or public platforms)
- **Educational sites** (like Grok Academy and others)
- **Random Like Challenges** (Maybe small challenges from cyber sites)   
## Structure

The repository is structured to track challenges by category, with each challenge solution documented in its own folder:
